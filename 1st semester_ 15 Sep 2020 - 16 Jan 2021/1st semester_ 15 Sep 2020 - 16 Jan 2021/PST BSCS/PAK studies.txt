			why democracy falils in the pakistan

Despite coming into existence 73 years ago, Pakistan is still endeavoring for an authentic and real democracy

	To begin, upon the creation of Pakistan, a constituent assembly was set up. Firstly, there was an extraneous delay in constitution-making, division of power were not set out and thus leading to political unrest. Moreover, dodging general elections for selecting the members of the constituent assembly meant that it was unrepresentative of the Pakistani population; indicating the lack of democratic process. Thus, since the very beginning, the Pakistani democracy was in shatters, laying down the foundations for a weak democratic system.

	Military interventions in the politics of Pakistan further annihilated the democratic system. Pakistan has experienced Military coups in 1958, 1977, and 1999, which weakened its democratic institutions, and adversely impacted the constitutional and legal developments of the country. As, under military regimes, there is no freedom of expression, creation of political parties, healthy competition, and freedom of the press; all of which are essential factors of a democracy. As a result, democratic values in Pakistani society were lost, and the present-day governmental system lacks political awareness. Thus, military interventions negatively impacted the democratic dynamics of Pakistan.

	 the Pakistani democratic system in many ways follows a monarchy rather than a democracy. There has been a dynastic rule of two families in Pakistan, which formed and led the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) and Pakistan Peopleâ€™s Party. The fact that these political parties have dominated over the Pakistani political system, and prevented the ingress of other political parties beats the essence of democracy. As, in a true democratic system, new political parties and members are accepted, acknowledged, and promoted. Thus, the dynastic rule of families has affected the Pakistani democratic system.

	it is possible to find ways to establish an effective democratic system This can be done through raising political awareness, creating student unions in colleges and universities so that individuals can be informed on true democratic values.
