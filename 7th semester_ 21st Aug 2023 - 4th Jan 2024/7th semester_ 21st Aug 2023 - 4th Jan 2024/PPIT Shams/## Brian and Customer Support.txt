//// china company want IP 


# Will they steal our IP?

**1. Introduction to Prime ElektroTek and the Deal Announcement:**

- Prime ElektroTek's evolution from a power supply manufacturer to a designer of hybrid electric powertrains.
- The Chairman’s announcement of the deal with Blue Sky Vehicles, which marks Prime's entry into the electric vehicle market.
- The Chairman's optimistic statement: "At last, we have a foothold in the electric vehicle market."

**Wang Hsi-Guo's Concern:**
Wang Hsi-Guo, the engineer who led the development of Prime’s powertrain technology, is not celebrating the deal with Blue Sky Vehicles. His concerns are multifaceted:

1. **IP Theft and Reverse Engineering:** Wang fears that once Blue Sky acquires the components, they will disassemble them to understand and replicate the technology.
2. **Loss of Competitive Advantage:** He believes that the result of the IP theft will be the loss of Prime’s technological edge in the market, as Blue Sky could start manufacturing and selling similar components.
3. **Skepticism About Blue Sky's Intentions:** Wang is wary of Blue Sky’s actual plans. He doubts their commitment to a genuine partnership, suspecting that their real goal is to absorb Prime’s technology and improve upon it.
4. **Pessimism About the Deal's Outcome:** He expresses a lack of trust in the deal's long-term prosperity for Prime, suspecting that it might only benefit Blue Sky.

**Lin Tung-Hsin's Response:**
Lin, the VP and general manager, responds to Wang's concerns with a different perspective:

Blue Sky was buying only select components. It wasn’t buying the vehicle control unit, a critical part of the hybrid drive train. For another, Prime had embedded a great deal of tacit knowledge into some components—knowledge that was more “know why” than pure know-how. Lin had argued that although an outside company might be able to make facsimiles of the components, copying the hardware without understanding how it worked would result in a car that was close but not exactly right. Third, Lin had stated bluntly, Blue Sky’s engineers didn’t seem all that sharp when it came to systems engineering. In technical discussions with them, Lin had observed that although they were skilled at narrow design tasks, they weren’t very good at understanding big, complex systems designs.

1. **Real-world Business Risks:** Lin acknowledges Wang's nervousness but suggests that to succeed, Prime must be willing to take risks, especially with significant Chinese customers like Blue Sky.
2. **Underestimation of Blue Sky's Capabilities:** Lin downplays the risk of Blue Sky reverse engineering the components, possibly underestimating their technical capabilities.
3. **Strategic Necessity:** He points out that before the Blue Sky deal, Prime had limited options (referring to Apex), implying that partnering with a big player like Blue Sky is a strategic necessity for growth.
4. **Confidence in Embedded Knowledge:** Lin believes that Prime’s components contain tacit knowledge that is not easily replicated, providing some protection against IP theft.

**Details About Apex Automotive:**
Apex Automotive is a smaller, third-tier Taiwanese company and was an early customer of Prime. The relationship between Apex and Prime is characterized by:

1. **Early Adoption of Prime’s Technology:** Apex was impressed by a test car Prime had built—a hollowed-out blue Volvo equipped with Prime’s drivetrain and battery pack.
2. **Collaborative Relationship:** Wang enjoyed working with Apex because of their freewheeling attitude and loyalty to Prime. He had led a team that created several prototypes for them.
3. **Limited Growth Opportunity:** Despite the positive working relationship, the Chairman of Prime made it clear that partnering with small companies like Apex wouldn’t allow Prime to become a significant player in the auto components business.
4. **Strategic Shift:** This pushed Prime to seek partnerships with larger, more influential companies, ultimately leading to the deal with Blue Sky, despite the increased risk of IP theft.

**5. The Chinese Market and Intellectual Property (IP) Risks:**

- Lin’s acknowledgement of China as the “IP Badlands,” a place where companies often lose control over their IP.
- The case study references Prime's past experience with IP theft when a Chinese computer maker began selling copied versions of Prime’s power supplies.

**1. Cloning and Reverse Engineering:**

- **Previous Experiences:** Prime had already faced IP theft when a Chinese computer maker cloned their power supplies and sold them at steep discounts.
- **Engineer Expertise:** Chinese engineers are adept at disassembling and replicating products, a practice that has affected many industries and companies operating in China.

**2. Legal and Enforcement Challenges:**

- **Weak IP Laws:** While there are laws against cloning and reverse engineering, the enforcement of these laws is often weak or ineffective.
- **Court System Efficacy:** Pursuing legal action in Chinese courts rarely results in the recovery of damages significant enough to offset the cost and effort of litigation.

**3. Leakage and Widespread IP Abuse:**

- **Spread of Trade Secrets:** Once a trade secret is exposed, it tends to spread rapidly to other companies within the country.
- **Difficulty in Containing IP:** This widespread dissemination makes it nearly impossible to contain IP once it has been compromised.

**4. Competitive Dynamics:**

- **Risk of Local Competitors:** Virtually every company in China is viewed as a potential threat to foreign IP, including state-owned enterprises like Blue Sky.
- **Strategic Implications:** For Prime, the partnership with Blue Sky carried the risk of the latter becoming a vertically integrated manufacturer, potentially competing in the same market with Prime's own technology.
- The Chairman’s repeated inquiries to Lin about the potential of Blue Sky stealing Prime’s technology, reflecting a high level of concern about IP risks.

**6. Technical Aspects of Prime’s Products and Blue Sky’s Capabilities:**

- Prime’s competitive edge lies in its powertrain electronics which Wang believes are superior.
- Lin reassures the Chairman that Blue Sky would not be able to reverse engineer all components, underestimating Blue Sky’s capabilities.
- Lin’s observations during his meetings with Blue Sky engineers, leading him to conclude that they lack expertise in systems engineering.

**7. Blue Sky’s Aspirations and Prime’s Contributions:**

Blue Sky was doing its part to help China meet its goal of producing half a million “new energy” vehicles in the next few years. Using components from Prime and other suppliers, Blue Sky was committed to rolling out at least five hybrid models within 12 months.

**8. Visit to Blue Sky and Observations:**

- Lin and Wang’s visit to Blue Sky’s manufacturing facilities in Guangzhou, exposing them to the scale of Blue Sky’s operations.
- Blue Sky’s commitment to rolling out hybrid models and their reliance on Prime’s components.
- The celebratory mood during the visit, contrasted with Wang’s skepticism and probing questions about Blue Sky’s capabilities in developing the VCU.

**9. Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) – The Heart of the Dispute:**

- Prime’s development of a VCU specifically for Blue Sky, which was packed with embedded tacit knowledge.
- Blue Sky’s initial decision to develop its own VCU, reflecting a desire to be seen as a first-tier automaker.
- The challenges Blue Sky faces in creating their VCU and the resulting performance issues with their prototype vehicle.
- Lin got behind the wheel, stepped on the accelerator, and started driving around the loop. He could tell that something was wrong; he had expected much crisper performance, and the gas engine seemed to be cutting in too soon. Clearly the control system needed major work.

**10. Intellectual Property Negotiations and Ultimate Conundrum:**

- Blue Sky’s demand for IP ownership as a condition of the deal, including source code and control algorithms.
- Lin’s shock at the condition and the Chairman’s frustration, as stated: “Blue Sky will accept our vehicle control unit only if the IP belongs to them.”
- The strategic dilemma facing Prime: whether to concede IP to secure the deal or risk losing their position in the Chinese market.
    
    “They claim they need it,” the chairman said. “Without the IP, they say, they won’t have any use for the other components we were hoping to sell them. So, they’ll find another supplier who will give them the whole package. But if we accept these terms, how can we sustain a business in China?
    
    ### Should Prime release the IP for its vehicle control unit?
    

As the chairman of Prime, the decision to release the IP for the vehicle control unit (VCU) to Blue Sky would demand a rigorous assessment of risks versus rewards. The primary responsibility in such a leadership role is to safeguard the long-term interests of the company while also pursuing growth opportunities. Here’s how the situation could be analyzed from that perspective:

**1. Strategic Long-Term Vision:**

- **IP as a Core Asset:** The VCU technology is a core asset, and its IP represents a significant competitive advantage. I would be extremely cautious about giving away proprietary technology that could erode our market position.
- **Future Innovation Pipeline:** I would consider whether Prime has the capability to continue innovating at a pace that would keep us ahead of any potential competition, even if the current IP were compromised.

**2. Assessing Market Dynamics:**

- **China's Market Potential:** The Chinese market presents a huge opportunity for growth. I would evaluate whether the potential revenues from Blue Sky could be reinvested into new R&D to develop the next generation of technologies.
- **Competition and Collaboration:** I would also assess the competitive landscape, determining whether Blue Sky is the right partner and whether there are alternatives that could offer similar growth opportunities without demanding IP rights.

**3. Risk Management:**

- **Legal Protections:** I would explore whether there are any legal frameworks or protections that could be put in place to secure our IP, even if shared, such as licensing with restrictions on usage, or patents that protect our technology in China.
- **Backup Plans:** It's prudent to have contingency plans. I would consider what strategic moves we could make if the partnership failed or if Blue Sky turned into a competitor.

**4. Negotiation Leverage:**

- **Bargaining Position:** I would negotiate aggressively to maintain as much control over the IP as possible. This could include partial IP transfer, licensing with royalties, or setting up a joint venture where we have significant control.
- **Tiered Release:** If releasing some IP is inevitable, I might consider a tiered approach where we provide enough to fulfill Blue Sky’s immediate needs but hold back the core of our IP for future negotiations.

**5. Stakeholder Interests:**

- **Shareholder Value:** Any decision must account for shareholder interests. I would need to ensure that the decision to release the IP does not harm the company’s valuation.
- **Employee Considerations:** As the technology creator, employees like Wang are key stakeholders. I would factor in their concerns and the potential demotivating impact of seeing their work possibly compromised.

**6. Competitive Edge and Differentiation:**

- **Maintaining the Edge:** How will Prime maintain its competitive edge if the IP is released? I would need to ensure that we have other differentiators beyond the current VCU technology.

**Conclusion as the Chairman:**
Given the high stakes, my inclination would be to explore every possible alternative to outright IP transfer. If there's no viable option other than releasing the IP, I would proceed only with strong safeguards in place, such as a robust legal agreement, a structured IP release schedule, and clear strategic benefits that outweigh the risks. The decision would not be taken lightly and would involve extensive consultation with legal advisors, the board of directors, and key stakeholders within the company.




## Brian and Customer Support

**Brian's Initial Complaint:**

- Brian expressed his frustration with the DRM system causing technical issues.
- He has been unable to use a game he pre-ordered and received a week ago.
- Technical support suggested his problems might be due to using a pirated version, which he found outrageous.
- Brian pointed out that DRM is negatively impacting the second-hand games market.
- He vowed never to give business to the company again due to the lack of resolution and support.

**Customer Support's Response:**

- The company acknowledged the problems caused by DRM for a minority of users.
- They stated that the DRM was implemented due to significant piracy of their games in the past.
- Customer Support expressed regret but defended the necessity of DRM to combat piracy.

**Brian's Argument on Piracy:**

- He disagreed with the equivalence of pirated downloads to physical theft, as not all pirated copies represent lost sales.
- Brian argued that intellectual property has value but questioned the blanket statement that "piracy is always wrong."

**Customer Support's Defense of Intellectual Property:**

- They contended that the cost of content creation goes beyond physical materials, thus intellectual property cannot be devalued.
- The representative cited examples to argue against moral justifications for piracy.

**Brian's Points on File Sharing:**

- Brian referenced Lawrence Lessig's categories of file sharers, highlighting the gray areas and potential benefits of some types of file sharing. A B C D
- He inquired about updates on the patch for the game while discussing the nuances of copyright laws and the impracticality of waiting for content to become public domain.

**Customer Support's Stance on File Sharing:**

- They dismissed the entitlement associated with types B and C file sharing as leading to type A (pure piracy).
- Customer Support argued that piracy harms creators and consumers by driving up prices and necessitating DRM.

**Brian on DRM and Piracy Benefits:**

- Brian criticized DRM for being intrusive and potentially harmful, likening it to malware.
- He mentioned historical and technological examples where piracy led to innovation and growth, suggesting piracy can have unintended benefits.

**Customer Support's Rejection of Piracy:**

- They refuted the idea that piracy is beneficial and criticized the Pirate Bay for profiting from piracy.
- Customer Support emphasized the negative impacts of piracy on their business and the broader industry.

**Brian's Continued Frustration:**

- He reiterated his issues with the game and DRM, mentioning that a pirated version would likely work without problems.
- Brian shared a list of potential technological solutions to combat piracy in a new forum thread.

**Final Exchange:**

- Brian expressed dissatisfaction with the technical support's handling of his case, accusing them of unethical behavior.
- Customer Support denied unethical behavior but admitted that technical support is limited in resources.
- They reiterated that DRM's inconveniences are a result of piracy, not the company's intention.
- In the end, Customer Support informed Brian that they could not issue a refund or develop a patch due to cash flow issues.

Throughout the dialogue, both Brian and Customer Support cite several examples to support their arguments:

**Brian's Cited Examples:**

- The quick demise of DRM audio CDs, particularly referencing the Sony BMG rootkit scandal that caused security vulnerabilities.
- Apple’s DRM-free iTunes Store, as part of Steve Jobs’ initiative to remove DRM, which had previously restricted music to be played only on iPods and up to five computers【11†source】.
- The historical origins of Hollywood, which started by filmmakers evading Thomas Edison's patent laws
- The United States' first hundred years where foreign copyrights were not recognized
- Disney's history of extensive "borrowing" and refining of ideas
- The role of Napster in the boom of high-speed Internet and its connection to the iPod's success

**Customer Support's Cited Examples:**

- The quote from Mark Helprin's book "Digital Barbarism" on the misconceptions of piracy advocates
- The comment by Jeff Raikes from Microsoft on piracy potentially leading to future licensed software use, and Bill Gates' view on the competition between Microsoft Windows and Linux in China
- The Pirate Bay as an example of a platform that promotes and profits from piracy, despite legal repercussions for its owners

Both parties use these examples to argue their perspectives on DRM, piracy, and intellectual property rights. Brian uses examples to show the potential benefits or complexities of piracy, while Customer Support uses them to underline the harms of piracy and the value of intellectual property.
