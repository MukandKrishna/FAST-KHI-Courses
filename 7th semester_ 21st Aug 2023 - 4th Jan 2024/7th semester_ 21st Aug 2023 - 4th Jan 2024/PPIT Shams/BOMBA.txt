********************critical questions that might arise and need to be addressed through analysis:

1. **Breach of Confidentiality**: Did Raghu sign any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements that he may have breached by taking proprietary designs and client information when he left SNB?

2. **Intellectual Property Rights**: What specific intellectual property rights does SNB have over its designs, and how can these be enforced against Raghu’s use of the stolen designs?

3. **Non-Compete Clauses**: Were there any non-compete clauses in Raghu's employment contract that would restrict him from starting a competing business within a certain time frame or geographic location?

4. **Contractual Remedies**: What legal remedies are available to SNB under the contract with SSP for the abrupt termination, and what evidence is needed to prove any breach?

5. **Client Poaching**: Can it be legally established that Raghu poached the high-budget movie project from SNB, and if so, what are the potential legal consequences?

6. **Damage Assessment**: How can the extent of the damage caused by Raghu’s departure be quantified in financial terms, and what compensation might SNB be entitled to?

7. **Vendor Relations**: What steps should Sunitha take to secure her relationships with vendors and clients to mitigate the risk of them moving their business to Raghu’s new venture?

8. **Reputation Management**: What strategies should SNB employ to manage and protect its reputation in the wake of this incident?

9. **Internal Controls**: What internal controls could have been implemented to prevent such theft of intellectual property and documents?

10. **Future Safeguards**: How can SNB revise its contracts, employee onboarding, and management processes to safeguard against similar incidents in the future?

11. **Legal Action**: Should SNB take immediate legal action against Raghu, and what are the potential outcomes or risks associated with this?

12. **Strategic Response**: Beyond legal action, what strategic business responses can SNB employ to address the competitive threat posed by Raghu's new venture?

Each of these questions requires a detailed analysis of the contractual documents, employment agreements, intellectual property laws, and the strategic business implications of the actions taken by both Raghu and Sunitha. Legal counsel, possibly with specialization in intellectual property and employment law, should be involved to provide expert advice and guide the response to this complex situation.



Answers: 



1. **Breach of Confidentiality**: If Raghu signed a confidentiality agreement and took designs, SNB could legally challenge him for breaking that agreement.

2. **Intellectual Property Rights**: SNB owns the designs created under its brand. If Raghu uses them, SNB can sue for copyright infringement.

3. **Non-Compete Clauses**: If Raghu's contract included a non-compete clause, SNB could enforce it to stop him from operating his new business for a certain period.

4. **Contractual Remedies**: SNB should review the contract with SSP for any breach clauses. If SSP terminated unfairly, SNB could seek compensation.

5. **Client Poaching**: If SNB can prove Raghu took the client unlawfully, they may claim damages. Evidence like emails or witness statements will be crucial.

6. **Damage Assessment**: SNB must calculate lost profits due to Raghu's departure and could claim these losses if suing Raghu.

7. **Vendor Relations**: Sunitha should quickly reassure vendors and clients of continued quality service to keep their business.

8. **Reputation Management**: SNB should communicate transparently with stakeholders about the incident and its resolutions to maintain trust.

9. **Internal Controls**: SNB can introduce stricter access controls to sensitive information and more regular audits of their operations to prevent theft.

10. **Future Safeguards**: SNB should update contracts to include stricter IP and confidentiality clauses and conduct regular IP rights training for employees.

11. **Legal Action**: SNB should consider the cost and benefits of legal action. If Raghu's actions caused significant harm, suing might be a good option, but it could also be expensive and time-consuming.

12. **Strategic Response**: Beyond suing Raghu, SNB should focus on strengthening its brand, perhaps by launching new designs or marketing campaigns to overshadow the competition.

In each case, Sunitha should consult with her legal advisor to understand the full extent of her rights and the most prudent course of action.
