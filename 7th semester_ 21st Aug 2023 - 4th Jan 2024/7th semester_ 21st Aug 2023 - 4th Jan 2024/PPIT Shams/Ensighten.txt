- **Client Prospects**: Close to landing Global Media, Incorporated (GMI), a Fortune 50 company.

### Business Challenge and Strategy

### Background of Josh Manion

- **Education**: Graduated from MIT in 2001.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Founded [forathletes.com](http://forathletes.com/) during college, later sold to [Myteam.com](http://myteam.com/).
- **Career Path**: Worked as a consultant post-acquisition, then in network technology startup, before starting Stratigent, a web analytics consulting business.
- **Motivation**: Sought to transition from a consultancy (dollars-per-hour model) to a software business model.

### Stratigent: Consulting Business

- **Timeline**: Operated from 2002 to 2009.
- **Growth**: Grew to approximately 25 employees.
- **Insight**: Noticed a recurring problem among clients that could be solved with software.

### Web Analytics and Tag Management Problem

- **Issue**: Difficulty in tracking consumer behavior on websites due to complexity and volume of tags.
- **Market Inefficiency**: Companies struggled with managing tags efficiently, causing delays and additional costs.

### Ensighten’s Solution

- **Innovation**: Developed a tag management system to simplify the tracking process.
- **Business Model**: Company owned by Manion and his wife; no VC funding initially.
- **Product**: Cloud-based, server capacity contracted from leading providers.
- **Revenue Model**: Based on the number of websites, client domains, and traffic volume.
- **Initial Pricing**: Around $200,000 in annual licensing fees plus a $25,000 setup charge.
- **Configuration Time**: Approximately one week for service configuration.
- **Value Proposition**: Significant time savings and enhanced functionality for clients.
- **Trust Building**: Early customer acquisition involved convincing large enterprises of Ensighten's reliability, which affected contract terms like source code escrow and termination restrictions.

The technology allowed for a rules-driven approach to tag placement, which could result in a multitude of tag permutations on a page but remained relatively simple for Ensighten to implement. Once clients started using Ensighten's application, it became integral to their operations due to the significant time savings and valuable functionality it provided, which they previously struggled to achieve without such a tool.

A critical challenge for Ensighten was to build trust with large enterprises and convince them to rely on this system as a mission-critical platform within their infrastructure. This need for trust, particularly with the first few customers, was reflected in the stringent terms Ensighten had to agree to, such as providing source code escrow, transition plans, and restrictions on contract termination.

### Developing a Template Contract: Ensighten's Approach

- **Initial Template**: Developed with a Chicago law firm, effective for first three clients with little legal pushback.
- **Learning Phase**: Early deals revealed which terms customers might resist and which were critical to Ensighten.
- **Non-Negotiable Terms**:
    - Protection of intellectual property rights.
    - Avoiding indemnification that could be excessively costly.
    - Refusal of terms that could result in having to refund clients.
- **Flexibility**: Willing to accommodate reasonable changes, foreseeing that future clients may request similar amendments.

### Big Deal Challenges and Legal Expertise

- **Shift in Contract Dynamics**: Transitioned from using their template to a client-provided contract, which treated the software as work for hire, conflicting with Ensighten's licensing model.
- **Legal Expertise Gap**: Realization that existing attorney wasn’t specialized in IP and licensing issues.
- **Hiring Jim Quinn**: Based on a recommendation, Manion hired Quinn, who had relevant expertise in IP within the technology space.

### Learning and Cost Management

- **Direct Involvement**: Manion took an active role in learning from Quinn to handle future legal matters independently.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Aimed to minimize legal expenses for deal negotiations, avoiding the high costs of legal counsel for every transaction.

### Legal Perspectives and Modern Software Licensing

- **Traditional Licensing Model**: Explained by Quinn as revocable and restrictive, not conferring ownership, with examples like Microsoft and Oracle.
- **Cloud-Based Software Licensing**: Customer access to software functionality in the cloud without owning a copy, possibly licensing only the connector software on their hardware.
- **Legal Relationship**:
    - Manion and Quinn have never met in person.
    - Quinn advises on specific sections of agreements as requested by Manion.
    - Quinn clarifies that he only advises on the aspects he is asked about and does not review the entire document or the implications changes may have on other sections.
