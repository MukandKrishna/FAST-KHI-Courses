Dear Madam, 

I am writing to  request you to review my MID 2 answer copy as I feel my marks are below my expectations.

I studied the topics very well. i not only read and thoroughly rewieved the lecture notes,  but also read differnt books on the topics for morte information.

I have also attended all the classes,  and received postitive comments from you in class activities.

I am very certain that the paper has been marked fairly, but a review and response from you will help me avoid mistakes in the future and better understand communication.

Hoping for a positive response.

Thank You
