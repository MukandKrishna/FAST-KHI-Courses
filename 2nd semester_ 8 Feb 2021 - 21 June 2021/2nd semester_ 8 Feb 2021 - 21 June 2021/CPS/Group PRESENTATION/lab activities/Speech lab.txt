If i have to sum up the difference between greats and the average, succesful
and nobodies of the word. on attribute to describe the difference ,i.e., discipline

We all have this notion that one day we will suddenly become succesful
when something will happen to us. But that is never how anybody succeeds.

Success requires improving yourself 0.1 % at a time in little little factors. 
e.g, reducing your sleep by 10 minutes. SO, if I reduce my sleep by 10 min
will I become saint. NO, you will have 10 more min to utilize this time in a 
productive way. And If you keep doing this on a regular basis slowly you
find that you have transformed so much. The transformation at the end is 
amazing, and people dont realize this how it happens. 

This is the way people suceeds ,  it is not a blessing. e.g some saint has
put his hand on his disciple's head, Ok, now you are enlightened.  so you 
are not seeing the rest of the story.

If it was so cheap he will say alright nobody needs to learn anything. You just 
stand in the line and come. I will put my hand on everbody' head and you will
go to heaven.  

Every thing you will do make a difference. You have the dream and the vision,
that dream motivates you to get going. It comes from strong reason.  But that 
it is not enough, what you need is discipline and it keeps you going. 
the discipline to keep going when it hurts, because life doesnot give you
what you want, it gives you what you deserve. If you have not work hard
for it then you dont deserve it.  So, remain discpline and your time will come.
