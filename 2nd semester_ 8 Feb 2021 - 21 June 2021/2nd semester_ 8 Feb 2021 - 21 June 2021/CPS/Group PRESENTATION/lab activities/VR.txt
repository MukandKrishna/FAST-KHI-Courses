Virtual Reality applications  make use of virtual reality (VR), an immersive sensory experience that digitally simulates a virtual environment.
Applications have been developed in a variety of domains such as

Education and training

Heritage

Social science

Robotics

Military

Now i am describing some applications

	1.Entertainment

Modern Examples of VR for gaming include the Kinect, and the PlayStation Move/PlayStation Eye, all of which track and send player motions to the game. Many devices complement VR with controllers or haptic feedback.


	2. Healthcare and Medical
VR technology has many useful applications in the medical field. Through VR, novice surgeons have the ability to practice complex surgeries without stepping into the operating room.


	3. Digital marketing
VR can present high definition, three-dimensional interactive imaging.
Non-profit organizations have used VR to bring potential supporters closer to distant social, political and environmental issues in immersive ways not possible with traditional media

These were the applications of   VR

This was all from my side.
